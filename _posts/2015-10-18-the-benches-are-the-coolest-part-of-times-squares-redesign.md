description: "Times Square is undergoing a massive reconstruction that is, by Snøhetta principal Craig Dykers' estimation, about halfway done. Once completed at the end of 2016, the bowtie-shaped intersection in midtown New York City will include new above-ground pedestrian plazas and freshly minted sewer lines below. It will also, notably, include 11 new benches."
